# Hash Table Implementation

Implement a Hashtable Class with the following methods:

- set
Arguments: key, value
Returns: nothing

- get
Arguments: key
Returns: Value associated with that key in the table

- contains
Arguments: key
Returns: Boolean, indicating if the key exists in the table already.

- keys
Returns: Collection of keys

- hash
Arguments: key
Returns: Index in the collection for that key

 any methods you write should be clean, reusable, abstract component parts to the whole challenge. You will be given feedback and marked down if you attempt to define a large, complex algorith.
