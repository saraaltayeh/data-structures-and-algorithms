# Trees

Node:
A Tree node is a component that may contain its own values and references to other nodes

## Challenge

1. Binary Tree
Create a Binary Tree class

Define a method for each of the depth first traversals:
a. pre order
b. in order

post order which returns an array of the values, ordered appropriately.
2. Binary Search Tree
Create a Binary Search Tree class

## Approach & Efficiency

- The Big O for preOrder, inOrder, postOrder, add: O(n).
- The Big O for contains: O(log n).

## API
